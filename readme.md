### Tic Tac Toe

This is the read me file for my first WDI project!

[Play here](https://andrew-godman.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)



Done:

- [x] Render a game in the browser
- [x] Design logic for winning
- [x] Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- [x] git repository hosted on GitHub
- [x] readme.md
- [x] Switch turns
- [x] At least one artefact of either pseudocode, flow diagram, wireframe, mockup or storyboard demonstrating planning
- [x] Deploy your game online
- [x] Clean up code, check if anyone has won should be in a function for example

Todo:
- [ ] New UI design.
- [ ] Update todo list :(

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Switch turns** between more than one player
* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** principles
* Use **Javascript** for **DOM manipulation**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

### Necessary Deliverables


* **today** - At least one artefact of either pseudocode, flow diagram, wireframe, mockup or storyboard demonstrating planning - **Due today** 
* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your GitHub repo
* A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with a link to your hosted game, and **frequent commits** dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

### Bonus extensions

These are for extra credit! DON'T focus on these until you've hit the core requirements.

* Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter
* Allow game customizable options, time limits, board size, game rounds, name & profiles etc  
* Allow players to customize their token (X, O, name, picture, avatar etc)
* Get inventive with your styling - research CSS effects, animations to spiff things up
* **Research** **LocalStorage** or **SessionStorage** to persist data locally to allow games to continue after page refresh or loss of internet connectivity
* Use timers to display "waiting..." messages while users are waiting to be matched
* **Research** web audio API and add sound effects to your game
* Be creative! Bend the rules and give it a twist!
### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, markup, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, debugger, etc) to debug and solve problems
* Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your game each night, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
* **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
